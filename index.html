					<p class="comment">A fantastic hunting experience brought by Capcon. Become master of fourteen different weapons to explore this dynamic world! Hunt down monsters, and discover the mystery of the land. Monster Hunter: World has a rewarding combat system that require a lot of time and devotion to master a weapon. For players who are interested in the monsters, Capcon makes all the monsters alive with their intricate AI built not only to fight players but also to make a logical eco-system. The game is a true time-killer, because it requires time to both practice your skills and collect resources for equipment upgrades. </p>
